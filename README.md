# 🎬 Letterboxd Wrapped Project

## Overview
This project is a personal data analysis and visualization of my movie-watching history using data from **Letterboxd** and **The Movie Database (TMDB)**.  
The goal was to create a “wrapped” summary of my movie preferences similar to Spotify Wrapped — showing trends, favorites, genres, and other fun insights.
